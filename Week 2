#2.2 Write a program that uses raw_input to prompt a user for their name and then welcomes #them. Note that raw_input will pop a dialog box. Enter Sarah in the pop-up box when you #are prompted so your output will match the desired output below.
#
#out put:

# The code below almost works

name = raw_input("Enter your name")
print "Hello %s" % name

#2.3 Write a program to prompt the user for hours and rate per hour using raw_input to #compute gross pay. Use 35 hours and a rate of 2.75 per hour to test the program (the pay #should be 96.25). You should use raw_input to read a string and float() to convert the #string to a number. Do not worry about error checking or bad user data.
#
#Output:
#
#96.25
#
# The code below almost works

# This first line is provided for you

hrs = raw_input("Enter Hours:")
rate = raw_input("Enter Rate:")
cost = float(hrs)*float(rate)

print "Pay: %s" % cost
